Moonboards are a great tool for a climber to get stronger and work on technique. A moonboard consists of a grid of standardized holds, oriented at a fixed angle, that uses lights to indicate which holds are "active" during the climb. A problem begins with hands on the starting holds illuminated green, and feet on any of the identical holds in the foot box (if permitted by the problem). A climb is complete when both hands match on the final hold, illuminated by red, using any of the highlighted blue holds.

This code provides a pipeline to extract move sequence data from moonboard climbing videos. An example for using the datascraper
can be found by following and running src/datascraper/main.py. 

More details and updates can be found on my website https://dchurchill.me/mooncoachAI/ as I develop the code.
